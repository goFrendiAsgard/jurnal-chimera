# THE PROCESS:
#   f = ((a+b) * (a-b)) + a
# THE SUBPROCESSES
#   Process 1: c = a + b 
#   Process 2: d = a - b
#   Process 3: e = c * d
#   Process 4: f = e + a
# THE FLOW
# Process 1 and Process 2 will be executed in parallel since they both aren't depend to each another
# After Process 1 and Process 2 finished, Process 3 and Process 4 should be executed in serial as Process 3 depend on both Process 1 and 2, and Process 4 depend on Process 3
